<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Shanice and I'm interested in becoming a web developer. I'm having so much fun doing this project!
  I just can't wait for the day that I can start creating more advanced projects. As of today, 12/29/24, I am starting to feel more confident when I code.
  I'm really looking forward to making websites and building mobile applications.</p>
