# HTML-Portfolio-

This is my first project. 

This project was created to demonstrate my ability to design and structure a basic website using only HTML. The goal was to build a functional and organized portfolio showcasing my work while gaining hands-on experience with HTML fundamentals.  

Deployed via GitHub Pages, this project serves as a foundation for further web development endeavors. It highlights:  

- **HTML Proficiency**: Focusing on clean, semantic markup to structure content effectively.

- **Project Highlights**: Features simple, static web pages that showcase specific projects like a Movie Ranking System and a Birthday Invitation page.  
- **Practical Learning**: Reinforced my understanding of web accessibility, proper formatting, and the importance of a well-organized file structure.

This portfolio reflects the beginning of my journey into web development, laying the groundwork for more complex projects involving CSS, JavaScript, and beyond.
